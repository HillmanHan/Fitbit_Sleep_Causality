# Fitbit_Sleep_Causality
## Introduction 
The aim of our project is to examine if there is a causal relationship between the number of sedentary minutes for an individual recorded and their sleep quality. In our case, total sleep time in bed is used as a proxy for sleep quality. In order to determine if there exists a causal effect, we used methods varying from a simple linear model regression to a panel regression to do so.

Important Variables in Dataset:
TrakcerDistance - the distance traveled recorded by Fitbit
VeryActiveDistance - the amount of distance where the user was highly active (high heart rate)
VeryActiveMinutes - the total minutes where the user was highly active (high heart rate)
SedentaryMinutes - the total minutes where the user stays sedentary
Calories - amount of calories burned
SedentaryTreatment - whether the user has a sedentary minutes higher than average American's sedentary minutes
SedentaryMinutes: SedentaryTreatment - used to examine how the marginal changes if a user has a sedentary minutes higher than average American's sedentary minutes
TotalMinutesAsleep - our target variable, total minutes the user was asleep

This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.
